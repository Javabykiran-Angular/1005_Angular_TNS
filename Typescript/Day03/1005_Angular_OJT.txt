1 Difference between Angular Js & Angular 
	- js Based freamwork / typescript based 
	- MVC pattern / MVW pattern
	- effective memeory mang. not effective / effective memeory mang.  effective 
	- degrade its speed & performance / increase its speed & performance

2 what is Typescript?

- Typescript is Object Orientated Lang.
- Typescript is superset of javascript
- Developed By Mircosoft 2012
- It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft
its coding style is used like C++
- The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language
- ECMAScript standard + ECMAScript version6(JS) + Additional features(Opps Concept,module)=Typescript



Advantages
1 Strong static typing
       -TypeScript is a typed language, where we can specify the type of the variables, function parameters and object properties
inferred Type to mention Data type of Variable, if not mentioned Data type its by deafault take "any" Data type
2 Find Compile Time Error 
3 Supports 
  - Classess
  - Inheritance
  - interface
  - enum
  - Function Override

Disadvantage
- Browser Don't understand Typescript
	.ts +tsc (typescript compiler)=>.js (javascript)
	
- Generally TypeScript takes time to compile the code.


Installation
Steps
1 Installed Node
2 Installed  VSCode code editor
3 npm install -g typescript
 - npm = Node Package Manager
 -g = globally
internet is required

4 Simple pgm
	demo1.ts
	console.log("Hello world");
	tsc demo1.ts  & node demo1.js 
	
5 variable

	- null & undefined
	var a:number=10;
	
	var str!:string;
	var a=2.5;
